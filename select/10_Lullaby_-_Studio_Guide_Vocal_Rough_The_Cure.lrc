[00:40.96] On candy stripe legs the Spiderman comes
[00:46.40] Softly through the shadow of the evenin' sun
[00:51.09] Stealin' past the windows of the blissfully dead
[00:56.45] Looking for the victim shivering in bed
[01:01.98] Searchin' out fear in the gathering gloom
[01:06.59] And suddenly a movement in the corner of the room
[01:11.05] And there is nothing I can do when I realize with fright
[01:16.54] That the Spiderman is having me for dinner tonight
[01:41.54] 
[01:42.94] Quietly he laughs and shaking his head
[01:46.54] Creeps closer now, closer to the foot of the bed
[01:52.04] And softer than shadow and quicker than flies
[01:57.58] His arms are all around me and his tongue in my eyes
[02:03.04] Be still be calm be quiet now my precious boy
[02:07.51] Don't struggle like that or I will only love you more
[02:13.07] For it's much too late to get away or turn on the light
[02:17.52] The Spiderman is having me for dinner tonight
[02:40.02] 
[02:23.02] And I feel like I'm being eaten
[02:25.74] By a thousand million shivering furry holes
[02:33.06] And I know that in the morning
[02:34.97] I will wake up in the shivering cold
[02:38.59] And the Spiderman is always hungry
