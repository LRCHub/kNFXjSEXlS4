[00:47.16] I've been up for days
[00:48.99] And I feel like a menagerie
[00:50.77] I'm scratching till I bleed
[00:52.95] And I keep on seeing
[00:54.38] Imaginary lemurs
[00:55.24] In the street
[00:56.52] In the middle of the day
[00:58.52] But as long as I can breathe
[01:01.38] Then I know I'll be okay
[01:04.17] I'll be alright
[01:06.45] I'm out of mind
[01:09.26] I'm out of sight
[01:24.95] I'm out of sight
[01:32.95] 
[01:33.44] I've been up for days
[01:35.20] And I feel like a laboratory rat
[01:37.86] Inside a maze
[01:39.61] And I reel in the monotony of
[01:41.87] Screaming
[01:42.53] At the moon
[01:43.28] In the middle of the day
[01:45.01] But as long as I can see it
[01:47.24] Then I know I'll be okay
[01:50.92] I'll be fine
[01:54.41] I'm out of sight
[01:56.26] I'm completely out of mind
[02:10.66] Completely out of mind
[02:21.66] 
[02:20.95] Okay
[02:22.62] Alright
[02:24.67] Come and watch me shake tonight
[02:28.42] Mouth wide
[02:30.59] Soft and bright
[02:32.43] Bite my hand and scream
[02:36.32] Okay
[02:38.37] Alright
[02:40.20] Come and watch me break tonight
[02:44.30] Push deep
[02:46.11] Out of sight
[02:48.32] Bite my hand and hold on tight...
